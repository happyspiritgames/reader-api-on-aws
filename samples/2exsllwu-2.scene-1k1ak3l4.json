  "prose": "As you walk out of the Emporium with sacks of jewels, you pop one into your mouth.  Mmmm, yummy. After exchanging fist-bumps with Bob and Angel, they take off, and you turn toward the warehouse. Although your mouth is happy, your stomach is overcome with a sinking feeling. You just spent all of the ancient coins and notes. Now there is no way to escape the warehouse with the Golden Bars. Your mission has been thwarted.\nReluctantly, you walk down the sidewalk back to Headquarters. The Supreme Commander stops you as you attempt to sneak past her toward the spy lounge. At this point, you just want to get back to your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].  Instead, the Supreme Leader sends you to your bunk to think about your failed mission.\nLater at snack time, you eat carrot sticks, not the butter cookies you had hoped for. You can't win them all.",
