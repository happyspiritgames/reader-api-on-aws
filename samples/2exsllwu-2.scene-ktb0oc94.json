  "prose": "Climbing out on the pole, your fingers grasp the wood where the bark has been worn down.  Clearly, you are not the first to go out on [i]this[/i] limb.  You decide it would be best to hang below the pole, so you drop your legs down.  So far so good.  The pole gives a little as you slide farther out, just a bit more to see what’s happening.\nYour brain whirs into high gear as you realize you have gone too far and lose your grip.  As you fall, your cat-like reflexes help you twist, and when you hit the ground you roll just a bit.  Although you have prevented the worst, your left ankle took most of the weight of impact.\nKnowing defeat when it snears in your face, you hobble back to Headquarters.  The Supreme Commander pulls an ice pack from cold storage and applies it to your ankle, which is now the size of a grapefruit.  There may be a trip to the medic in your future.\nUntil then, you get to sit in front of the spy lounge televisor and play your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].  Too bad you don’t have any cookies to enjoy.",
