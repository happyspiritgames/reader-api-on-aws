The three of you head into the Emporium, with Angel in the lead and Bob behind you.  Your eyes take in the dazzling assortment of jewels, and an amazingly sweet smell fills your nose.\nNow that you have joined them, Bob and Angel confess that one problem remains.  They do not have any of the coins or notes they need to make a fair exchange.  You reach into your pocket and realize that you have the solution to their problem.  On one hand, you want to help their mission succeed, since you will get a share of the reward.  On the other hand, you have your own mission to complete.",
