  "prose": "Bob and Angel are still hanging around the Emporium as you walk past. You will see them on another mission at another time.\nAs you burst into Headquarters, the Supreme Commander looks up from her mission plans and greets you with a smile that betrays her relief at your safe return. You hand her the satchel with the Golden Bars and head for the spy lounge when she asks if you have any leftover coins.  The commander sure runs a tight ship. You hand her the contents of your pocket and dash for the lounge, where you flip on the televisor, grab a controller, and return to your favorite game, [i]Spy Lords of the Multiverse[/i].\nAfter an hour that feels like an instant, you break to enjoy some fresh butter cookies and milk. Uh oh, the Supreme Commander notices that you have run out of the White Elixir of Life. Are you ready for another mission?",
